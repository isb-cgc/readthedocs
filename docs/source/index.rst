Welcome to the ISB-CGC Documentation on Read the Docs.

Here you will find information describing the features of the ISB-CGC platform, 
tips on how to use it, and details about the data that we are hosting on the 
Google Cloud Platform.

The ISB-CGC aims to serve the needs of a broad range of cancer researchers ranging from 
scientists or clinicians who prefer to use an interactive web-based application to access 
and explore the rich TCGA dataset, to computational scientists who want to write their own 
custom scripts using languages such as R or Python, accessing the data through APIs, and 
to algorithm developers who wish to spin up thousands of virtual machines to analyze hundreds 
of terabytes of sequence data.

This documentation is a work-in-progress, please let us know how we can improve 
it. feedback@isb-cgc.org
