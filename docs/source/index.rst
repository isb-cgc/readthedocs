*Democratizing access to cancer data in the cloud*

Contained within this documentation are descriptions of ISB-CGC features along with guides and tips for exploring data sets hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.

The `ISB-CGC <https://isb-cgc.org>`_ aims to serve the needs of cancer researchers who would like to explore cancer data from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), Proteomics Data Commons (PDC), 
Imaging Data Commons (IDC) and other programs stored in user-friendly data sets on the Google Cloud in BigQuery tables, easily accessed through SQL. 
They can also access the data by writing their own custom scripts using languages such as R or Python, accessing the data through APIs, and by utilizing virtual machines to analyze hundreds of terabytes of sequence data.
