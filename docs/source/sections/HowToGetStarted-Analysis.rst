ISB-CGC enables researchers to analyze cloud-based cancer data through a collection of powerful web-based tools and Google Cloud technologies. Learn more about the different analytical methods ISB-CGC users employ on their research projects. 

Interactive web-based Cancer Data Analysis & Exploration
##########################################################
Explore and analyze ISB-CGC cancer data through a suite of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow users to select and
filter data from one or more public data sets (such as TCGA, CCLE, and TARGET), combine these with your own uploaded data and analyze using a variety of built-in visualization tools.

Cancer data analysis using Google BigQuery
##########################################################
Processed data are consolidated by data type (ex. Clinical, DNA Methylation, RNAseq, Somatic Mutation, Protein Expression, etc.) from sources including 
the Genomics Data Commons (GDC) and Proteomics Data Commons (PDC) and transformed
into ISB-CGC Google BigQuery tables. This allows users to quickly analyze information from thousands of patients in curated BigQuery tables using Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL can be used from the Google BigQuery Console but can also be embedded within Python, R and complex workflows, providing users with flexibility. The easy, yet cost effective,  “burstability” of BigQuery allows you to, within minutes (as compared to days or weeks on a non-cloud based system), calculate statistical correlations across millions of combinations of data points.
