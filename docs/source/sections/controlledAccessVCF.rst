Controlled Access VCF 
*******************


Accessing Controlled Data 
============
ISB-CGC Bigquery interface contains tables which hold senstivie information about patients. These type of files are known as controlled access files. To obtain access to our controlled data please follow the steps in our `Accessing Controlled Data <https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/Gaining-Access-To-Controlled-Access-Data.html>`_ page to obtain permission.   



Variant Call Format (VCF)
================

Variant Call Format files (VCF) are the standard file format to store identified variants within sequenced data. The creation of VCF files start from sequencing whole genome or whole exome sequencing that create FASTQ files. The file containing the sequenced genome is then aligned to the appropriate reference genome which then generates a SAM, BAM, or CRAM files. The last step to generate the VCF file from either of the three alignment files, the differing aligned reads will be identified when comparing to the reference genome and written out to a VCF file.

As variant data is increasing and growing in size researchers face the problem of being able to analyze all the new data arriving as well as the old data. The new and old VCF files that are being curated by all these programs (Ex. TCGA,TARGET, and FM) are stored as individual files on local HPCâ€™s for download. Researchers face the problem of analyzing these large scale data at once to gain insights for the analysis they are running. ISB-CGC has developed an ETL pipeline to take Controlled Access VCF files found at Genomic Data Commons. This transforms pipeline is able to take the terabytes of variant data found at GDC and transform them into one large and flattened Google BigQuery table. The transforms pipeline ISB-CGC has developed allows researchers to query, use command line tools, or use a programming language of your choice to gain statistical insights of an analysis someone might be interested in.
