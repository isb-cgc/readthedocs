Programmatic Access 
*******************

Programmatic access to the data and metadata is provided through a combination of ISB-CGC APIs and Google APIs. The majority of the ISB-CGC data in BigQuery tables and in Google Cloud Storage is accessed directly via Google Cloud tools and interfaces. Access to ISB-CGC metadata and user-data such as cohort definitions is provided through the ISB-CGC programmatic API described below.

A growing set of tutorials and programming examples illustrating how you can work with these hosted data sets from a variety of programming environments such as Python and R, using Google Compute Engine VMs and the Google Genomics Pipelines (GGP) service are provided in our github repositories, also described below.
