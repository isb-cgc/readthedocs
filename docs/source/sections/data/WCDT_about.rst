About the Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
---------------

The overarching goal of the Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer study is to illuminate molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapeutic agents, and particularly androgen signaling inhibitors, in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

About the Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Data
--------------------

West Coast Prostrate Cancer Dream Team (WCDT) data is available from the biopsies of castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases collected during the study. The data consists of 101 cases with over 202 whole-genome sequencing files and 792 RNA sequencing files consisting of 83TB of data. The Project ID in the GDC Data Portal is `WCDT-MCRPC <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/WCDT-MCRPC>`_.

For more information on the WCDT data, please refer to these sites:

- `GDC Data Portal <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=cases&filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22WCDT%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D>`_

Accessing Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Data on the Cloud
--------------------------------

Besides accessing the files on the GDC Data Portal, you can also access them from the GDC Google Cloud Storage Bucket, which means that you donâ€™t need to download them to perform analysis. ISB-CGC stores the cloud file locations in tables in the ``isb-cgc-bq.GDC_case_file_metadata`` data set in BigQuery.

- To access these metadata files, go to the Google BigQuery console.
- Perform SQL queries to find the WCDT files. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT active.*, file_gdc_url
  FROM `isb-cgc-bq.GDC_case_file_metadata.fileData_active_current` as active, `isb-cgc-bq.GDC_case_file_metadata.GDCfileID_to_GCSurl_current` as GCSurl
  WHERE program_name = 'WCDT'
  AND active.file_gdc_id = GCSurl.file_gdc_id

Accessing the WCDT Data in Google BigQuery
------------------------------------------------

ISB-CGC has WCDT data, such as clinical and RNA-seq, stored in Google BigQuery tables. Information about these tables can be found using the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://bq-search.isb-cgc.org/>`_ with WCDT selected for filter PROGRAM. To learn more about this tool, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search documentation <../BigQueryTableSearchUI.html>`_.

The WCDT tables are in project isb-cgc-bq. To learn more about how to view and query tables in the Google BigQuery console, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Tables documentation <../BigQuery.html>`_.

- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.WCDT`` contains the latest tables for each data type.
- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.WCDT_versioned`` contains previously released tables, as well as the most current table.
