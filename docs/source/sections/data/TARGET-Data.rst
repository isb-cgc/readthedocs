About the TARGET Data
***********************

The ISB-CGC currently hosts over 70 terabytes of TARGET_ data in Google Cloud
Storage (GCS_) and in BigQuery_.  

.. _TARGET: https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target
.. _GCS: https://cloud.google.com/storage/
.. _BigQuery: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/

The ISB-CGC platform is one of NCI's 
`Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots <https://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots/nci-cloud-initiative>`_ 
and part of our mission is to host the TARGET data in the cloud so that researchers around the world 
may work with the data without needing 
to download and store the data at their own local institutions.

The controlled-access data in Google Cloud Storage is not yet available for
access but will be in June or July of this year.

The open-access data includes RNA-seq and miRNA-seq expression levels, and is available
in BigQuery, along with the open-access clinical and biospecimen information.
