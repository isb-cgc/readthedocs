About the Quantitative Digital Maps of Tissue Biopsies Program
------------------------------------------------------------
The program and its data are described in the paper `Rapid mass spectrometric conversion of tissue biopsy samples into permanent quantitative digital proteome maps <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4390165/>`_.

About the Quantitative Digital Maps of Tissue Biopsies Data Set
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The PCT SWATH Kidney Study is available at the `Proteomics Data Commons (PDC) <https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/>`_. 
ISB-CGC has procured data from this study through the PDC API.

Accessing the Quantitative Digital Maps of Tissue Biopsies Data in Google BigQuery
------------------------------------------------

ISB-CGC has Quantitative Digital Maps of Tissue Biopsies clinical data stored in Google BigQuery tables. Information about these tables can be found using the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://bq-search.isb-cgc.org/>`_ with QUANT MAPS TISSUE BIOPSIES selected for filter PROGRAM. To learn more about this tool, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search documentation <../BigQueryTableSearchUI.html>`_.

The tables are in project isb-cgc-bq. To learn more about how to view and query tables in the Google BigQuery console, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Tables documentation <../BigQuery.html>`_.

- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.Quant_Maps_Tissue_Biopsies`` contains the latest tables for each data type.
- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.Quant_Maps_Tissue_Biopsies_versioned`` contains previously released tables, as well as the most current table.
