**TARGET**:  Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments

TARGET applies a comprehensive genomic approach to determine molecular changes that drive 
childhood cancers. Investigators form a collaborative network to facilitate discovery 
of molecular targets and translate those findings into the clinic. TARGET is managed by 
NCI's Office of Cancer Genomics and Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.

The TARGET data is available at the GDC, both in the 
`legacy archive <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/search/f?filters=%7B%22op%22:%22and%22,%22content%22:%5B%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22cases.project.program.name%22,%22value%22:%5B%22TARGET%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D>`_
which contains over 10,000 files for over 5,000 cases.  
Virtually all of this data is low-level (and controlled-access) sequence data 
(including 1702 RNA-seq files, 765 miRNA-seq, with the remainder being WXS or WGS DNA-seq BAMs).
Some of this data has been re-processed and is available on the main 
`GDC Data Portal <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects?filters=~%28op~%27and~content~%28~%28op~%27in~content~%28field~%27projects.program.name~value~%28~%27TARGET%29%29%29%29%29>`_.
This newer dataset so far includes 6183 files representing 3236 cases, and totaling over 17 TB.
Over half of the files (3740) are controlled-access files, including BAM, VCF, and MAF file types, 
based on WXS, RNA-seq, and miRNA-seq data.
The remaining 2443 open-access files, include RNA-seq and miRNA-seq quantification,
as well as clinical and biospecimen supplement files.
