About the CDDP Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) Program
------------------------------------------------------------
The `Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology <https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cancer-cases-controls/eagle-study>`_ (EAGLE) program investigated the genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer and smoking persistence. It integrated analysis of genetic, environmental, clinical, and behavioral data.

About the CDDP EAGLE Data Set
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Data from the CDDP EAGLE Program are available at the `Genomics Data Commons (GDC) <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/>`_.  It includes data from the Integrative Analysis of Lung Adenocarcinoma project.

Accessing the CDDP EAGLE Data on the Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides accessing the files on the GDC Data Portal, you can also access them from the GDC Google Cloud Storage Bucket, which means that you donâ€™t need to download them to perform analysis. ISB-CGC stores the cloud file locations in tables in the ``isb-cgc-bq.GDC_case_file_metadata`` data set in BigQuery.

- To access these metadata files, go to the Google BigQuery console.
- Perform SQL queries to find the CDDP EAGLE files. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT active.*, file_gdc_url
  FROM `isb-cgc-bq.GDC_case_file_metadata.fileData_active_current` as active, `isb-cgc-bq.GDC_case_file_metadata.GDCfileID_to_GCSurl_current` as GCSurl
  WHERE program_name = 'CDDP_EAGLE'
  AND active.file_gdc_id = GCSurl.file_gdc_id


Accessing the CDDP EAGLE Data in Google BigQuery
------------------------------------------------

ISB-CGC has CDDP EAGLE data, such as clinical and metadata, stored in Google BigQuery tables. Information about these tables can be found using the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://bq-search.isb-cgc.org/>`_ with CDDP EAGLE selected for filter PROGRAM. To learn more about this tool, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search documentation <../BigQueryTableSearchUI.html>`_.

The CDDP_EAGLE tables are in project isb-cgc-bq. To learn more about how to view and query tables in the Google BigQuery console, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Tables documentation <../BigQuery.html>`_.

- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.CDDP_EAGLE`` contains the latest tables for each data type.
- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.CDDP_EAGLE_versioned`` contains previously released tables, as well as the most current table.
