New Program Data Available in Google Cloud Storage
=======================================

We have new program data available via Google Cloud Storage. While we work on adding all the new programs to other parts of our systems we have created this document as a work around.  This tutorial will enable you to find files in Google Cloud Storage via the Data Commons' Framework tool IndexD. If you have any additional questions or comments please feel free to contact feedback@systemsbiology.org. 

New Programs

Foundation Medicine Adult Cancer Clinical Dataset (FM-AD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Foundation Medicine adult cancer clinical dataset consists of 18,004 unique solid tumor samples that underwent genomic profiling on a single uniform platform as part of standard clinical care. The dataset is derived from the FoundationOneÂ® genomic profiling assay version 2 that interrogates exonic regions of 287 cancer-related genes and selected introns from 19 genes known to undergo rearrangements in human cancer. For more information please `visit <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001179.v1.p1/>`_. 

The Data Use Aggreement for Foundation Medicine can be found `here <https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs001179.v1.p1>`_. 


Clinical Trial Sequencing Project (CTSP) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the Clinical Trials Sequencing Project (CTSP), National Cancer Institute (NCI) will utilize whole genome sequencing and/or whole exome sequencing in conjunction with transcriptome sequencing to try to identify recurrent genetic alterations (mutations, deletions, amplifications, rearrangements) and/or gene expression signatures that would be important to the hypothesis(es) submitted by the investigators. The samples will be processed and submitted for genomic characterization using pipelines and procedures established within The Cancer Genome Analysis (TCGA) project. For more information please `visit <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001175.v2.p2>`_. 

The Data Use Aggreement for The Clinical Trial Sequencing Project can be found `here <https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs001175.v2.p2>`_. 


VA APOLLO Project - Research for Precision Oncology (VAREPOP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Research for Precision Oncology Program (RePOP) is a research activity that establishes a cohort of Veterans diagnosed with cancer and who have had genomic analyses performed on their tumor tissue as part of standard of care. All data relevant to a patient's cancer and cancer care will be collected under RePOP, including patient demographics, co-morbidities, genomic analysis, treatments, medications, lab values, imaging studies, and outcomes. All RePOP participants will have signed/verbal informed consent and signed HIPAA authorization to have their data stored and shared from RePOP's Precision Oncology Program Data Repository (PODR). For more information please `visit <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001374.v1.p1>`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integrative analysis of genetic lesions in 574 diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). The study investigates genomic structural variation, genetic alteration and its effect on the development and biology of lymphomas by using high throughput sequencing, gene expression, and methylation status.

URL to find file information in IndexD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are currently able to use IndexD via a URL. Default URL is https://nci-crdc.datacommons.io/index/ 

You add the GDC UUID at the end of URL at the moment. Highlited in green below is where the Google Cloud Storage path is via the JSON return.

How to use Google Cloud Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have available tutorials and guides on how to access data in Google Cloud Storage and can be found  `here <https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/HowToGetStartedonISB-CGC.html#iii-accessing-and-analyzing-data-stored-in-gcs>`_. 

Cheat sheets available `here <https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/DIYWorkshop.html#isb-cancer-genomics-cloud-isb-cgc>`_.



Using multiple GDC UUUIDs with IndexD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this example we will show how to find the URLs when using multiple UUID's with IndexD.  The URL needed when using multiple UUIDs is https://nci-crdc.datacommons.io/index/index/?ids= each UUID should be comma seperated. 

example URL: https://nci-crdc.datacommons.io/index/index/?ids=a3e62c00-9cd0-4662-aefc-0559dab3bb1c,e916a56f-9d64-4172-829d-03ee2fe2d704


In example below we will have four UUIDs called from IndexD.  We will then use the control + F button feature in web browser to find the Google Cloud Storage path we are looking for in JSON file return. 

URL used is: https://nci-crdc.datacommons.io/index/index/?ids=a3e62c00-9cd0-4662-aefc-0559dab3bb1c,e7b41733-c0b8-4104-834a-234fb9f8caa2,243b3398-5b1c-4530-8903-1cc6275ba8be,e916a56f-9d64-4172-829d-03ee2fe2d704

GDC UUIDs used: 

- a3e62c00-9cd0-4662-aefc-0559dab3bb1c
- e7b41733-c0b8-4104-834a-234fb9f8caa2
- 243b3398-5b1c-4530-8903-1cc6275ba8be
- e916a56f-9d64-4172-829d-03ee2fe2d704

If you select control + F button then search for term urls you will be able to find the GCS paths you are looking for in json return.
