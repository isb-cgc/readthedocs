TARGET Data by Access Class
#############################

Open-Access TARGET Data
=========================

The open-access TARGET data hosted by the ISB-CGC Platform includes:

* Clinical (de-identified) and Biospecimen data: these data were originally provided in XML files (Level-1) by the TARGET DCC;
* Gene (mRNA) expression data:  these data were originally provided as TSV files (Level-3) by the TARGET DCC;
* microRNA expression data:  these data were originally provided as TSV files (Level-3) by the TARGET DCC;

.. _in_BigQuery:

in BigQuery
-----------

The information scattered over thousands of XLSX and TSV files at the GDC is provided in 
a *much more accessible* form in a series of `
`BigQuery tables <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/data/data2/data_in_BQ.html#target-clinical-biospecimen-and-molecular-data>`_.

Controlled-Access TARGET Data
===============================

The controlled-access TARGET data is not yet accessible but will be soon, please
stay-tuned for updates and let us know if you have an urgent need for this data.
(Please note that you will need to obtain dbGaP authorization first, so if you
do not yet have that, you should begin that process.)

in Google Cloud Storage
-----------------------

All controlled-access TARGET data will be available as files in GCS, in their original form
(*ie* BAM or FASTQ files).
