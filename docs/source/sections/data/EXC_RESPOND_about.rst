Accessing the Exceptional Responders Data in Google BigQuery
------------------------------------------------

ISB-CGC has Exceptional Responders data, such as clinical, stored in Google BigQuery tables. Information about these tables can be found using the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_ with EXCEPTIONAL RESPONDERS selected for filter PROGRAM. 
To learn more about this tool, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search documentation <../BigQueryTableSearchUI.html>`_.

The Exceptional Responders tables are in project isb-cgc-bq. To learn more about how to view and query tables in the Google BigQuery console, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Tables documentation <../BigQuery.html>`_.

- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.EXC_RESPONDERS`` contains the latest tables for each data type.
- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.EXC_RESPONDERS_versioned`` contains previously released tables, as well as the most current table.
