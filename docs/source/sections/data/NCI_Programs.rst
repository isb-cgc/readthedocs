NCI Cancer Programs
********************

In recent years, the 
`National Cancer Institute <https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci>`_,
in collaboration with other institutes within 
`NIH <https://www.nih.gov/>`_,
has invested in the production and analysis of several large datasets.
The ISB-CGC platform is funded by NCI in an effort to make these
data more accessible and usable.

The initial goal of the `ISB-CGC <http://www.isb-cgc.org>`_ was
to host the data produced by `The Cancer Genome Atlas <https://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga>`_ program.
We are now expanding to host data from `TARGET <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target>`_ 
(a pediatric cancer program), and will in
the future host data from newer projects supported by the
`Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci>`_.

Please see the individual sections below for more information about
these individual, large-scale programs.
