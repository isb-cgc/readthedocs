TCGA Overview
*************

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to 
accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the 
application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale 
genome sequencing.

The overarching goal of TCGA is to improve our ability to diagnose, 
treat and prevent cancer. To achieve this goal in a scientifically rigorous 
manner, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome 
Research Institute (NHGRI) used a phased-in strategy to launch TCGA. 
A pilot project developed and tested the research framework needed to 
systematically explore the entire spectrum of genomic changes involved 
in more than 20 types of human cancer.

This massive effort was launched in 2006.  
The final samples were shipped in mid-2014,
and analysis of the data produced by this program continues to this day.
