A single API for all storage classes
=====================================
Cloud Storageâ€™s consistent API, latency, and speed across storage classes simplifies development integration and reduces code complexity. Implement Object Lifecycle Management to set a Time to Live (TTL) for objects, archive older version of objects, or downgrade storage classes without compromising on latency or accessibility. Set custom policies to transition data seamlessly from one storage class to the next, depending on your cost and availability needs at the time.
