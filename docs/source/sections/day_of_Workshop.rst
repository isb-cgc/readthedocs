ISB-CGC Workshop
****************

This information is currently intended for attendees of the August 2nd workshop at ISB.
After the workshops, all materials will be made available as part of the
ISB-CGC documentation here on readthedocs.

If you want to have another look at the Pre-Workshop information we sent you, `here <Workshop_prep_Aug2016.html>`_ it is.

Before we get started ...
#########################

As soon as you've found a seat and opened up your laptop, please do the following:

* check your email for the latest workshop information, including links to materials as well as a link to a WebEx session -- you do *not* need to join the WebEx, but you might find it a useful way to see the what is being projected directly on your laptop;

..

* sign into your Chrome browser using the Google identity you provided to us, or the "temporary" Google identity that was given to you this morning;

..

* go to the Google Cloud Platform `Console <https://console.cloud.google.com>`_

  + you should not have to sign in again, but if you are asked to, use the same Google identity again
  + in the top blue bar, towards the right, you should see a project name, *eg* "ISB-CGC Workshop" -- if you are a member of two or more projects, then you will be able to select a project using that pulldown;

..

* if you have any questions or are unable to access the Google Cloud Console, please *raise your hand!*

..

* if you *do* have your own GCP project, now would be a good time to make sure that you have certain APIs enabled.  (If you don't know how, take a look at `this tutorial <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isb-cgc/readthedocs/master/docs/include/enabling_new_APIs.pdf>`_.)  Specifically, you will need these APIs enabled (some may already be enabled by default):

      + Google Compute Engine
      + Google Genomics
      + Google Cloud Logging
      + Google Cloud Pub/Sub

..

* find out what access-privileges you have in your GCP project: go to the `IAM & Admin <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam>`_ section of the Cloud Console, look for your identity (*eg* gmail address) and look at which Role(s) are listed to the right;

..

* just for fun, if you have time: in a separate browser tab, open up the BigQuery `Web UI <https://bigquery.cloud.google.com>`_

  + click on the red *COMPOSE QUERY* button in the upper left corner, and then cut and paste the simple SQL query below into the **New Query** box and then click on the red **RUN QUERY** button
  + try out the *Format Query* button, and the *Explanation* button above the Results
  + try modifying the query to make it invalid and then click on the red exclamation mark (below the query box on the far right)
  + you can find additional information about accessing and working with the ISB-CGC BigQuery tables on several other pages here on readthedocs -- try typing "BigQuery" into the "Quick search" box over in the left panel!
  + at the bottom of this page are links to several quickstart tutorials -- one of them is all about BigQuery
