**Feature Alert** : When working with a workbook you can now plot TARGET miRNA genomic build HG38 data! For more 
information please see the workbooks 
documentation `here. <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/webapp/Workbooks.html#creating-and-saving-a-workbook>`_
 
**Feature Alert** : When working with cohorts you can now build a cohort using genomic build HG38 somatic mutation data 
using the molecular tab! For more information please see the molecular tab
documentation `here. <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/webapp/Saved-Cohorts.html#molecular-tab>`_ 


**Feature Alert** : You can create cohorts using analyzed data types using genomic build HG38 for TCGA and 
TARGET programs! For more information please see the selected program panel tab
documentation `here. <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/webapp/Saved-Cohorts.html#program-selection-panel>`_

**Feature Alert** : The user interface now displays the same nomenclature as the Genomic Data Commons (GDC). 

**Feature Alert** : You can now use the IGV browser to view genomic build HG38 TCGA data! For more information please see the IGV browser how
