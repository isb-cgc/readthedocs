*******************
Programmatic Access
*******************

Programmatic access to the data and metadata is provided through a combination of ISB-CGC
APIs and Google APIs.  The majority of the TCGA data in BigQuery tables and in Google Cloud Storage is 
accessed directly via Google Cloud tools and interfaces.  
Access to ISB-CGC metadata and user-data such as cohort definitions is provided through
the ISB-CGC programmatic API described below.

A growing set of tutorials and programming examples illustrating how you can work with these TCGA data using a variety of
programming environments such as Python and R, or grid computing systems such as GridEngine
are provided in our github repositories, also described below.
