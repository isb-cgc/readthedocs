Programmatic Access
*******************

Programmatic access to the data and metadata is provided through a combination of ISB-CGC
APIs and Google APIs.  The majority of the ISB-CGC data in BigQuery tables and in Google Cloud Storage is 
accessed directly via Google Cloud tools and interfaces.  
Access to ISB-CGC metadata and user-data such as cohort definitions is provided through
the ISB-CGC programmatic API described below.

A growing set of tutorials and programming examples illustrating how you can work with these 
hosted data sets from a variety of
programming environments such as Python and R, using Google Compute Engine VMs
and the Google Genomics Pipelines (GGP) service
are provided in our github repositories, also described below.
