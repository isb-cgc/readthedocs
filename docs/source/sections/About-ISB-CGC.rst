About the ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud
***********************************

The ISB-CGC provides interactive and programmatic access to the TCGA data, 
leveraging many aspects of the Google Cloud Platform including BigQuery, 
Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Datalab and Google Genomics.  
Open-access clinical and biospecimen information for all TCGA patients 
and samples, combined with the Level-3 TCGA data and genomic reference and 
platform-annotation sources are stored in BigQuery, enabling fast SQL-like 
queries against the entire dataset.  Controlled-access DNA and RNA 
sequence data is available to dbGaP-authorized users in the original BAM 
and FASTQ file formats.

The ISB-CGC aims to serve the needs of a broad range of cancer researchers 
ranging from scientists or clinicians who prefer to use an interactive 
web-based application to access and explore the rich TCGA dataset, to 
computational scientists who want to write their own custom scripts using 
languages such as R or Python, accessing the data through APIs, to algorithm 
developers who want to spin up thousands of virtual machines to rapidly 
analyze hundreds of terabytes of sequence data.  The ISB-CGC allows scientists 
to interactively define and compare cohorts, examine the underlying molecular 
data for specific genes or pathways of interest, and share insights with 
collaborators around the globe.
