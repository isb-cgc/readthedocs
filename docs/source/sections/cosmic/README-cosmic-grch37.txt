The sample name can be derived from a number of sources. In many cases it originates from the cell line name. Other sources include names assigned by the annotators, or an incremented number assigned during an anonymisation process. A number of samples can be taken from a single tumour and a number of tumours can be obtained from one individual. A sample id is used to identify a sample within the COSMIC database. There can be multiple ids, if the same sample has been entered into the database multiple times from different papers.

[5:E]                 Sample name,Sample id,Id tumour                    A sample is an instance of a portion of a tumour being examined for mutations. The sample name can be derived from a number of sources. In many cases it originates from the cell line name. Other sources include names assigned by the annotators, or an incremented number assigned during an anonymisation process. A number of samples can be taken from a single tumour and a number of tumours can be obtained from one individual. A sample id is used to identify a sample within the COSMIC database. There can be multiple ids, if the same sample has been entered into the database multiple times from different papers.
