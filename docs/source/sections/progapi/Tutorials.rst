R, Python and SQL Tutorials
**********************

For ISB-CGC users who want to perform custom analyses by writing R or Python scripts, 
we have begun to assemble a set of examples in two public github 
repositories: `examples-Python <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python>`_
and `examples-R <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-R>`_.  R users can 
work from the familiar environment of `RStudio <https://www.rstudio.com/>`_, 
and Python programmers can
enjoy the richness available in IPython notebooks by taking advantage of
the newly released `Cloud Datalab <https://cloud.google.com/datalab/>`_ 

**Note:** That Cloud Datalab is a beta release, but Google has released documentation on how to install Cloud Datalab locally  `here <https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-local>`_ and how to Run Cloud Datalab notebooks on Google Cloud Platform `here <https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-gce-frontend>`_ .

These repositories contain numerous examples that will help you learn 
to access and analyze the TCGA data in BigQuery, as well as examples
showing how to use our APIs to query the metadata and discover where to find the data
that you are looking for in Google Cloud Storage.

In addition there is the  `Query of the Month Club <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/QueryOfTheMonthClub.html?highlight=query%20of%20the%20month>`_ where there are multiple examples of using SQL queries to analyze the data housed in BigQuery.

We encourage the community to provide feedback on these tutorials and also to 
add your own examples to enrich this public resource!
