ISB-CGC Endpoints Tutorial
==========================



Programmatic access to molecular data and metadata within the ISB-CGC platform uses a combination of ISB-CGC APIs and Swagger UI documentation. 

The ISB-CGC API provides an interface to the ISB-CGC metadata stored in CloudSQL, and consists of several “endpoints”, implemented using Google Cloud Endpoints. Details about these endpoints can be found below. 

Some example use-cases include:


 - obtaining detailed metadata about a particular patient or sample;
 - creating (or retrieving a previously saved) cohort of patients and samples, based on a defined set of criteria;
 - retrieving a cohort's file manifest using the cohort ID;
 - retrieve a cohort's file manifest based on filters provided;
 - register, refresh, unregister a specified Google Cloud Project;



The Swagger UI(ADD PROD LINK) can be used to see details about each endpoint, and also provides a convenient interface to test an endpoint through your web browser. Following the link in the previous sentence will take you to a page with a list of APIs, in which each API consists of a set of functionally-related endpoints. Together, these individual APIs make up the ISB-CGC API. 


Cohorts are the primary organizing principle for sub setting and working with the TCGA data. A cohort is a list of samples and a list of patients. Users may create and share cohorts using the ISB-CGC web-app and then programmatically access these cohorts using the Swagger UI. (TCGA samples are identified using a 16-character “barcode” e.g. TCGA-B9-7268-01A, while patients are identified using the 12-character prefix, i.e. TCGA-B9-7268, of the sample barcode. Other datasets such as CCLE may use other less standardized naming conventions).

To get a better understanding of Swagger UI, let’s explore the Swagger ISB-CGC example. In the ISB-CGC example, the site is generated using Swagger UI.

The endpoints are grouped as follows:

 - cohorts
 - files
 - users
 


Authorize your request
======================


Before making any requests, you would normally authorize your session by clicking the Authorize button and completing the information required in the Authorization modal pictured below:
