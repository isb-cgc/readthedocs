Creating a variable favorites list is a way of creating custom groupings of the samples and/or cases that you are interested in analyzing further. For example, you can create a variable favorites list that spans across multiple projects, only contains samples for which certain types of data are available, or focuses on specific phenotypic characteristics. A Variable Favorites list can be included in a workbook.

Create Variable Favorites List
##############################

To create a variable list from **Your Dashboard**, click on the **Create Variable Favorites** link which will display the **Create Variable Favorite** screen. 

Or, from the menu dropdown, select **Create Variables Favorite List** from the **VARIABLES** menu dropdown. 

To create a new Variable Favorite:

- Name your new favorite; you can create many favorites and use them later when working with workbooks.
  
- Select attributes and features for your variable list by performing one or more of these actions:
  
  - Select a data set (program) from the **Select Data Set** drop down list. This will display features for that data set under the **COMMON** and **CLINICAL SEARCH** tabs.

  - *Common Filter Selection* - Filters (attributes and features) that are fairly common across programs are displayed under the **COMMON** tab. Changing the data set will change the list of available filters.
  
    * Check the checkbox adjacent to each feature that you are interested in. They will display in the **Selected Variables** panel. 
    
  - *Clinical Filter Feature Search* - Click the  **CLINICAL SEARCH** tab. This filter allows the user to search by any clinical feature in the selected data set (program). Changing the data set will change the list of available filters.

  - *Favorites Filter Selection* - From the Data Set drop down list, select **Favorites**. This displays your existing Variable Favorite lists, and their component features. These features can now be selected for a new Variable Favorite list by checking the checkbox adjacent to each feature that you are interested in.
