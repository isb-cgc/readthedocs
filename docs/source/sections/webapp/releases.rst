Web-App Release Notes
*********************

* **July 31, 2017**: 

 **Please Note:** When creating large cohort you will be given a red error message saying, “There was an error saving your cohort; it may not have been saved correctly.”  This issue is planned to be resolved in the next sprint.

 Issues that have been resolved in sprint 17 as of 07/31/2017

 New Enhancements

 - You will be returned a more detailed error message when using invalid characters when working with user data uploading titles. 
 - On the File list page you will are allowed to select only one genomic build at a time for better clarification of which build you will view on the IGV browser.

 Bug Fixes

 - When working with Swap Values button on a worksheet, the log option selected for either axis is now carried over as well when the swap values button is selected. 
 -  On the IGV browser when working with TCGA data build hg38 the interface will no longer return a No feature found with name “efgr” at the bottom of the IGV browser page. 
 -  When working with the cohort.create API endpoint you have the ability to create a large cohort with the barcode filter without a timeout error. 
 - When creating a cohort with the cohort.create API endpoint you can view the list of barcodes from the cohort details page in the ISB-CGC user interface irrelevant of size.  
 - When working with the create a new variable favorites list page, you can now create a variable list using the USER DATA tab. 


 Known issues in sprint 17 as of 07/31/2017

 - The sharing feature for Workbooks, Cohorts, and User Uploaded Programs is currently disabled
 - Analysis Type : Seq peek Formatting Elongated on occasion 
 - The CCLE data in GUI is not parallel to the CCLE data in BigQuery.  
 - Cannot plot any data if you use a CCLE data cohort on a worksheet.

The same issue can be found in reverse if you select the ‘blue x’ on the confirmation page for  set operation you can then select the delete button and see the cohort on the confirmation panel.
 - The set operation for existing cohorts complement is behaving exceptionally slow. 
 - A duplication of the exact cohort happens when you select the confirmation multiple times while the page is loading working with Set Operations.
 - When working with a new worksheet or a duplicate worksheet with workbooks for categorical features e.g bar chart you can select the log option. The log option only applies to numerical options.
 - When working with workbooks, if you select the delete confirmation button multiple times while the page is loading you will be sent to an error page. 
 - You currently cannot plot user uploaded data when working with workbooks.
 - When plotting, certain values will be displayed as numerical when it should be a categorical value e.g Tobacco Smoking History. 
 - The mouse over feature is currently disabled for program TARGET with disease code ALL.
 - The cohort.list API endpoint will display the incorrect cases count for cohort listed.
 - The Download File List as CSV on the File List page downloads the wrong information when genomic build hg38 is selected. 
 - You are currently able to add non-whitelist characters to edit section for user uploaded data.
 - You are returned a vague error message on the register a Google Cloud Project page when attempting to register a Google Project you are not associated to.
  - The samples and cases filters have not been removed from the cohort.list API endpoint and are visible as a possible filter.
  - The user.get CCLE program API endpoint will return a 503 internal server error.
 


* **June 14, 2017**: `v3.1 <https://github.com/isb-cgc/ISB-CGC-Webapp/releases/tag/3.1>`_

**Please Note:**

    NOTE 1: A number of TCGA and CCLE case IDs shown below will have been removed from all cohorts since they are no longer available from NCI’s Genomics Data Commons, and ISB-CGC is trying to mirror that data as closely as possible.
 
    TCGA cases: TCGA-33-4579, TCGA-35-3621, TCGA-66-2746, TCGA-66-2747, TCGA-66-2750, TCGA-66-2751, TCGA-66-2752, TCGA-AN-A0FE, TCGA-AN-A0FG, TCGA-BH-A0B2, TCGA-BR-4186, TCGA-BR-4190, TCGA-BR-4194, TCGA-BR-4195, TCGA-BR-4196, TCGA-BR-4197, TCGA-BR-4199, TCGA-BR-4200, TCGA-BR-4205, TCGA-BR-4259, TCGA-BR-4260, TCGA-BR-4261, TCGA-BR-4263, TCGA-BR-4264, TCGA-BR-4265, TCGA-BR-4266, TCGA-BR-4270, TCGA-BR-4271, TCGA-BR-4272, TCGA-BR-4273, TCGA-BR-4274, TCGA-BR-4276, TCGA-BR-4277, TCGA-BR-4278, TCGA-BR-4281, TCGA-BR-4282, TCGA-BR-4283, TCGA-BR-4284, TCGA-BR-4285, TCGA-BR-4286, TCGA-BR-4288, TCGA-BR-4291, TCGA-BR-4298, TCGA-BR-4375, TCGA-BR-4376, TCGA-DM-A286, TCGA-E2-A1IP, TCGA-F4-6857, TCGA-GN-A261, TCGA-O2-A5IC, TCGA-PN-A8M9
 
    CCLE cases: LS123, LS1034
 
    NOTE 2: The number of cases and samples when viewed in the User Interface as compared to the BigQuery tables vary across all three projects (TCGA, TARGET, and CCLE).  This is because the user interface reflects the data available at the Genomic Data Commons, whereas data in BigQuery reflects either data at the original TCGA data coordinating center supplemented with Genomic Data Commons Data (for TCGA and CCLE), or for TARGET, data received from the TARGET data coordinating center, not the Genomic Data Commons.
 
    NOTE 3: We have removed Google Genomics functionality from the user interface. You will still be able to access CCLE open access data in Google Genomics from the command line. We are open to adding Google Genomics controlled data back into the user interface if you have a use case for it.  Also we are restructuring the handling of multiple Programs of data. Please feel free to provide `feedback <https://groups.google.com/a/isb-cgc.org/forum/#!newtopic/feedback>`_. 
 
    NOTE 4: For TARGET data the clinical and Gene Expression files themselves are available in the system. The bam files will be available soon!
