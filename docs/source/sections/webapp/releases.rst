* **June 14, 2017**: `v3.1 <https://github.com/isb-cgc/ISB-CGC-Webapp/releases/tag/3.1>`_

    **Please Note:**

    NOTE 1: A number of TCGA and CCLE case IDs shown below will have been removed from all cohorts since they are no longer available from NCI’s Genomics Data Commons, and ISB-CGC is trying to mirror that data as closely as possible.
 
    TCGA cases: TCGA-33-4579, TCGA-35-3621, TCGA-66-2746, TCGA-66-2747, TCGA-66-2750, TCGA-66-2751, TCGA-66-2752, TCGA-AN-A0FE, TCGA-AN-A0FG, TCGA-BH-A0B2, TCGA-BR-4186, TCGA-BR-4190, TCGA-BR-4194, TCGA-BR-4195, TCGA-BR-4196, TCGA-BR-4197, TCGA-BR-4199, TCGA-BR-4200, TCGA-BR-4205, TCGA-BR-4259, TCGA-BR-4260, TCGA-BR-4261, TCGA-BR-4263, TCGA-BR-4264, TCGA-BR-4265, TCGA-BR-4266, TCGA-BR-4270, TCGA-BR-4271, TCGA-BR-4272, TCGA-BR-4273, TCGA-BR-4274, TCGA-BR-4276, TCGA-BR-4277, TCGA-BR-4278, TCGA-BR-4281, TCGA-BR-4282, TCGA-BR-4283, TCGA-BR-4284, TCGA-BR-4285, TCGA-BR-4286, TCGA-BR-4288, TCGA-BR-4291, TCGA-BR-4298, TCGA-BR-4375, TCGA-BR-4376, TCGA-DM-A286, TCGA-E2-A1IP, TCGA-F4-6857, TCGA-GN-A261, TCGA-O2-A5IC, TCGA-PN-A8M9
 
    CCLE cases: LS123, LS1034
 
    NOTE 2: The number of cases and samples when viewed in the User Interface as compared to the BigQuery tables vary across all three projects (TCGA, TARGET, and CCLE).  This is because the user interface reflects the data available at the Genomic Data Commons, whereas data in BigQuery reflects either data at the original TCGA data coordinating center supplemented with Genomic Data Commons Data (for TCGA and CCLE), or for TARGET, data received from the TARGET data coordinating center, not the Genomic Data Commons.
 
    NOTE 3: We have removed Google Genomics functionality from the user interface. You will still be able to access CCLE open access data in Google Genomics from the command line. We are open to adding Google Genomics controlled data back into the user interface if you have a use case for it.  Also we are restructuring the handling of multiple Programs of data. Please feel free to provide `feedback <https://groups.google.com/a/isb-cgc.org/forum/#!newtopic/feedback>`_. 
 
    NOTE 4: For TARGET data the clinical and Gene Expression files themselves are available in the system. The bam files will be available soon!

    In collaboration with the GDC we now have TARGET pediatric cancer data available for analysis in the user interface.  You are now able to create cohorts and plot analysis with information from TARGET, TCGA, and CCLE data. 
 
    In addition, we have  replaced the previous APIs with a new version that supports  the new user interface.
 
    We have also released the analyzed data types that are based on genome build GRCh38 for TCGA and TARGET data.  GRCh37 (HG19) is also still available for TCGA, TARGET, and CCLE datasets.
 
    Workbooks, cohorts, and variables favorites list created before the data structure migration will still be available for analysis and have been labeled as legacy and version 1.  If you have difficulty using version 1 workbooks, please contact us

    **Please Note:**

    NOTE 1:A number of TCGA and CCLE case IDs shown below will have been removed from all cohorts since they are no longer available from NCI’s Genomics Data Commons, and ISB-CGC is trying to mirror that data as much as possible.
 
    TCGA cases: TCGA-33-4579, TCGA-35-3621, TCGA-66-2746, TCGA-66-2747, TCGA-66-2750, TCGA-66-2751, TCGA-66-2752, TCGA-AN-A0FE, TCGA-AN-A0FG, TCGA-BH-A0B2, TCGA-BR-4186, TCGA-BR-4190, TCGA-BR-4194, TCGA-BR-4195, TCGA-BR-4196, TCGA-BR-4197, TCGA-BR-4199, TCGA-BR-4200, TCGA-BR-4205, TCGA-BR-4259, TCGA-BR-4260, TCGA-BR-4261, TCGA-BR-4263, TCGA-BR-4264, TCGA-BR-4265, TCGA-BR-4266, TCGA-BR-4270, TCGA-BR-4271, TCGA-BR-4272, TCGA-BR-4273, TCGA-BR-4274, TCGA-BR-4276, TCGA-BR-4277, TCGA-BR-4278, TCGA-BR-4281, TCGA-BR-4282, TCGA-BR-4283, TCGA-BR-4284, TCGA-BR-4285, TCGA-BR-4286, TCGA-BR-4288, TCGA-BR-4291, TCGA-BR-4298, TCGA-BR-4375, TCGA-BR-4376, TCGA-DM-A286, TCGA-E2-A1IP, TCGA-F4-6857, TCGA-GN-A261, TCGA-O2-A5IC, TCGA-PN-A8M9
 
    CCLE cases: LS123, LS1034
 
    NOTE 2: The number of cases and samples when viewed in the User Interface as compared to the BigQuery tables vary across all three projects (TCGA, TARGET, and CCLE).  This is because the user interface reflects the data available at the Genomic Data Commons, whereas data in BigQuery reflects either (for TCGA and CCLE) data at the original TCGA data coordinating center supplemented with Genomic Data Commons Data, or for TARGET, data received from the TARGET data coordinating center, not the Genomic Data Commons.
 
    NOTE 3: We have removed Google Genomics functionality from the user interface. You will still be able to access CCLE open access data in Google Genomics from the command line. We are open to adding Google Genomics controlled data back into the user interface if you have a use case for it.  Also we are restructuring the handling of multiple Programs of data. Please feel free to provide `feedback <https://groups.google.com/a/isb-cgc.org/forum/#!newtopic/feedback>`_. 
 
    NOTE 4: For TARGET data the clinical and Gene Expression files themselves are available in the system. The bam files will be available soon!
