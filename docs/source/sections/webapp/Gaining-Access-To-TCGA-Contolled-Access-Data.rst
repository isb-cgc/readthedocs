Gaining Access to TCGA Controlled Access Data
*******************

To obtain access to TCGA Controlled Access Data (**either** through the Web Application or Google Virtual Machines) you **must** associate a Google Account with a valid NIH login that is associated with a dbGaP associated project (either an eRA account ID or an NIH account User ID) through the Web Application. For more information on how to obtain dbGaP authorization to access TCGA controlled access data go to our `Frequently Asked Questions page <../FAQ.rst>`_.

**Linking a valid NIH login with your Google Account** To link a valid NIH login with your Google Account that you have used to login to the ISB-CGC system, select the "persona" icon beside your login name (A in the image below) after you have logged into the ISB-CGC Web Application.

**What data can I access if I don't have a dbGaP Authorization?** (or I have not done the ISB-CGC login in the last 24 hours)  You can access all the open access data in ISB-CGC, both through the Web Application as well as the `Programmatic User Interface <../Prog-APIs.rst>`_.  For more information about the Cloud Hosted Data go to `this part of our online documentation <../Hosted-Data.rst>`_.
