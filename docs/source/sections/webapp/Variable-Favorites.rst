Variable Favorites
*******************
A variable Favorites list is a way of creating custom groupings of the samples and/or participants that you are interested in analyzing further. For example, you can create a variable favorites list that span across multiple projects, only contain samples for which certain types of data are available, or focus on specific phenotypic characteristics.

Creating and Saving a Variable Favorites List
##############################################
To create a variable list from the User Dashboard, click on the "Create Variable Favorite‚Äù link where you will be directed to the Create Variable Favorite Page. 

Variable Favorites List Creation page
======================================
Using the provided list of filters on the left hand side, you can select the attributes and features
that you are interested in.

By clicking on a program, the field will expand and provide you with additional filtering options in the Data Types section.
For example, when to select the TCGA tab you see a common filters section. The common filters section is shared across programs, so if the common filter is selected in one program it will be selected for all programs.
