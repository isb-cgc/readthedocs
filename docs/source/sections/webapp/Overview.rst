The ISB-CGC web application functionality is accessed through a Google account identity (freely available `with a new account <https://accounts.google.com/signupwithoutgmail?hl=en>`_ or `by linking to an existing email account <https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail>`_).  If you have not logged into the ISB-CGC application you will be presented with this page:

You login through the "Sign In" link at the upper right of the initial page (label "A" in the image above).  Also on this page are links to our project's overall documentation (including non GUI documentation) (B), our public GitHub repository (C), a link to provide feedback (D), a link to more information about ISB-CGC (E), and our required "Warning Notice" (F) indicating that this is a U.S. Government Sponsored Website and by using it you are accepting the policies associated with its use.

Upon logging in with a Google account identity, you will be presented with the following page:

This is your personal "Dashboard" where all your relevant Analyses, Gene Lists, Variable Lists, Cohorts, Projects (your own data), and Public Datasets are stored and readily accessible.  You can also create new Sample Analyses with various chart types through the Sample Analyses section.  Details of how to use each component are provided in individual subsections of this documentation.

Multiple Sample Analyses can be grouped into Workbooks (and saved for later use, editing, and sharing).  Workbooks are used to group together multiple related analyses, and can be used for sharing groups of analysis results with specific groups of people.  For example, you may have one study involving identifying gene mutations and pathways involved in Head and Neck Cancer (with a given research group) where you keep all the files in one Workbook, and another study with a different group of researchers investigating the average time after diagnosis of death of different lung cancers - stored in another Workbook.  Think of workbooks as virtual "excel spreadsheets" that various related analyses can be created in individual Worksheets and grouped together in one Workbook.

**IF YOUR SCREEN LOOKS LIKE THIS (how do I get to the main screen?):** If your screen looks like the image below (I am logged in (A in image) by I can't see my analyses pages ("Your Dashboard" - image above)) that is because some browsers save your Google Login as a cookie, and automatically signs you in.  To get to "Your Dashboard" push the "ISB-CGC" icon in the upper left (B in the image).  This will take you to the main analysis dashboard screen.

**Breadcrumbs** are displayed to show where you in the Web Interface as you move from one section to another (figure below).  These are live links, and can be used to rapidly navigate from one section of the interface to another.

The data that is being manipulated with the Web Application is the same data that is available through the programmatic APIs.  This includes the TCGA datasets, Public Datasets as well as your own private datasets.  Details of how to access and manipulate each of these datasets are provided in detail in specific documentation sections elsewhere in the documentation.

The Web Application was optimized for use with Google Chrome web browser.  That said, a huge majority of the functionality work with recent versions of other web browsers (e.g. Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer).  If there is an issue, please try Google Chrome browser to see if the issue is resolved.

If there are any issues, please do not hesitate to `contact us  <https://groups.google.com/a/isb-cgc.org/forum/#!newtopic/feedback>`_.
