* How to navigate.  Cookie Crumb interface in upper left to help in navigation
* What data am I working with?  All of TCGA?  Other data (e.g. CCLE)?  Is it the same data as from the non-GUI interfaces? Can I add my own data (link to Upload Project Data documentation)?  If so, can I see it?  Can others see it?  How can I share it for others?
* Is there any way to use the same data in the GUI and the non-GUI UI (e.g. saved cohorts I have made)?  Where can I find how to do that?
* How to get to Help, to other non-GUI documentation
