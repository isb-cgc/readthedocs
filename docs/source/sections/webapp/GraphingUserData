Graphing User Data
##############################

Once a user has `uploaded their own data`_ to the Web App, that data can be visualized using the same graphing tools that are available for graphing TCGA, CCLE, TARGET and BEATAML1.0 data.  However, the process for graphing user data is slightly different from how it is done for that data.

The boxes in the figure below are links that are used to graph user data.

Step 2: Create a Variables Favorite
####################################

* Click on the **Projects** tab to see the user supplied studies.
* Select the variables that will be available to graph.  Note that if the study has a large number of selections, using the browser search function can help locate the item.

Step 3: Graph the Favorites in a Workbook
#########################################
* From the Web App Dashboard, click on **Create a new Workbook**.
* Under the **Source Data** heading, select the Variables and Cohorts that you wish to use in the graph.  In each case you will be brought to a page listing all of the available Variables or Cohorts.  Simply select the desired ones and then click the **Add to Workbook** button.
* Under the **Analysis Type** heading, select the appropriate graph type.  This will cause a window to slide in from the right.
* Fill in the X and Y axis variables, select a variable to use for coloring and finally select the cohort to use.
