Menu
*******************
The **MENU** is a graphical control element which contains application navigational drop downs (Sub-links). The Menu bar's purpose is to supply quick and common links for application-specific functions / features such as: 

 * **Workbooks** - Workbooks store the Analyses you create -- and their related data.  Basically, the worksheets you create to conduct analysis based on the source data selected (i.e. Genes, Variables and Cohorts â€“ further explained later). From the Workbook link you will be able to quick link to the following:
     - *Recent* - (Displays your created workbooks and allow quick navigation to them)
     - *Saved* - (Displays all your saved workbooks and allows you to edit, duplicate or delete the workbook)
     - *Create a New Workbook* - (Quick Link to Workbook Creation, where you can select the data source)
     - *Sample Workbooks* - (**Coming Soon**)

 * **Projects** - You can upload from your own research projects or request a GCP project be setup by following the directions under **Support and Other Useful Links** - `Your Own Project <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sections/Support.html?highlight=project>`_
    - *Saved* - This has two "Tabs" **Saved Projects** you have created and **Public Projects** (see below)
    - *Upload Project Data* - Data uploading requires that you have a Google Cloud project set up for your account. Once a request is received (see `How to Request <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sections/Support.html?highlight=project>`_), a project is created in GCP for you and you will receive a completion confirmation email).
    - *Public Projects* - (Future Home for accessible public projects).  There are no public projects available at the moment. This also has two "Tabs"  **Public Projects** and **Saved Projects** you have created (see above).
 
 * **Analyses** - From here you can Create, Edit Details, Duplicate, Delete, or Share Sample Analyses. The analysis can be piloted  by creating a customized workbook with the specific data (Genes, Variables, Cohorts) you select to analyze and visualized/plot in one of the following manners:
    - *Bar Chart*
    - *Histogram*
    - *Scatter Plot*
    - *Violin Plot*
    - *Violin Plot with Axis Swap*
    - *Cubby Hole Plot*

 * **Genes** - From this Menu selection you can **Manage Gene Favorites**, **Create Gene Favorite(s)** or **Select Genes for a New Workbook**. Each of these categories provide a quick link to additional application-specific functions / features such as:
    - *Manage Gene Favorites* - Here you can:
    
      * Edit or Delete a Saved Gene Favorite(s), 
      * Start a New Workbook, 
      * Create a New Gene Favorites or 
      * Edit Gene Favorites (see Create Gene Favorite(s) description below).
    - *Create Gene Favorite* - Here you can:

      * Create a Gene Favorite for Analysis, To Create a New Gene Favorite - You provide a name and select the Gene. You can upload a stored Gene List or to aid in Gene selection, you can access the HGNC portal (Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee) via the "**View Gene Identifiers**" link under this Menu selection.
      * Save or Cancel a new creation. 
    - *Select Genes for a New Workbook* - This sub-menu has two feature:
      
      * Apply to New Analysis - Select a Favorite(s) Gene from the list shown of stored Favorites to Analyze 
      * Add (+) Apply to New Analysis - Basically navigates back to the **Create Gene Favorite** (See description above)  

 * **Variables** -  

 * **Cohorts** -
