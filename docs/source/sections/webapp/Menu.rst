*******************
The **MENU** is a graphical control element which contains application navigational drop downs (Sub-links). The Menu bar's purpose is to supply quick and common links for application-specific functions / features such as: 

 * **Workbooks** - (Workbooks store the Analyses you create -- and their related data.  Basically, the worksheets you create to conduct analysis based on the source data selected (i.e. Genes, Variables and Cohorts â€“ further explained later). From the Workbook link you will be able to quick link to the following:
     - *Recent* - (Displays your created workbooks and allow quick navigation to them)
     - *Saved* - (Displays all your saved workbooks and allows you to edit, duplicate or delete the workbook)
     - *Create a New Workbook* - (Quick Link to Workbook Creation, where you can select the data source)
     - *Sample Workbooks* - (**Coming Soon**)

 * **Projects** - (You can upload from your own research projects or request a GCP project be setup by following the directions under **Support and Other Useful Links** - `Your Own Project <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sections/Support.html?highlight=project>`_
    - *Saved* -
    - *Upload Project Data* - (Data uploading requires that you have a Google Cloud project set up for your account. Once a request is received (see `How to Request <http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sections/Support.html?highlight=project>`_), a project is created in GCP for you and you will receive a completion confirmation email).
