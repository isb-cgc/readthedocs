Pre-Workshop Information
************************

This information is currently intended only for attendees who have 
signed up for the 
`workshops at NCI on May 24th and 25th <https://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-workshop>`_.  
After the workshops, all materials will be made available as part of the
ISB-CGC documentation here on readthedocs.

**Please check back again before the day of the workshop!**

Step #1: Basic Information and your own GCP project
###################################################

Basic Information 
-----------------

**Please send the following information to info@isb-cgc.org ASAP** 

    * your Google identity (for example your gmail address)
    * are you bringing a Mac or Windows laptop?
    * do you have non-TCGA data that you want to begin analyzing during the workshop?

If you don't already have a Google identity, you can 
`create one <https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?dsh=308321458437252901&continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount#FirstName=&LastName=>`_.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project
-----------------------------------

Everyone should have their own GCP project set up **before** the day of the workshop.
We will also add everyone to a temporary "workshop" GCP project.

We'd like to encourage you to take advantage of the 
`free trial <https://cloud.google.com/free/>`_ offered by Google.
If you have already used this one-time offer (or there is some other reason you cannot use it)
let us know and we will set you up with an
ISB-CGC provided (and funded) project.  (We'll also be happy to do that for
you after you use the $300 free trial.)

**When you send us your Google identity, please let us know if you already have 
your own GCP project.**

Questions?
----------

Feel free to ask any other questions you might have about the workshops or
give us additional information about your specific use-case or goals for
the workshop.  The workshop will be your hands-on introduction to the ISB-CGC;
be assured that we will follow up with you after the workshops to provide
any additional support you will need.

* enable the following APIs for your GCP project: BigQuery, Genomics, and Compute Engine -- this should take `less than 5 minutes <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isb-cgc/readthedocs/master/docs/include/enabling_new_APIs.pdf>`_

**Suggested:**
* install the `Cloud SDK <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/>`_ on your laptop
